<Unassigned>,746,EXTREMLY HIGH - ASAP ,Violations ,NOISE ORDINANCE VIOLATION,,4509-00,09/16/16,"SENT EMAIL THIS MORNING.  

Good morning Lance and Sophie,
We have received NUMEROUS complaints in regards to the music being played REALLY loud from your store; Subway located at Pine Island Shopping Plaza.  The neighbors have called and walked into your store on multiple occasions requesting them to lower the music.  The level of the base and volume is disruptive to the patients and staff at the chiropractic center.  Besides the fact your employees is not being mindful of the other tenants, that the place of business next door is a therapeutic center and is disrupting the staff and  patients, but this is a violation of our noise ordinance policy.  
I personally walked into Subway last week to speak with employee in person and also went next door to hear how the music is coming through the walls.  During our conversation with the manager, I had to speak very loud to communicate and kept asking what she was saying because it was extremely loud.   We understand and realize that it is difficult to hear music  where they prepare food because of the noise of the ovens, microwave, etc.  We also understand that the music provider, Pandora,  plays each song at various volume levels, so I gave a couple of suggestions/solutions.  Perhaps moving the speaker and mounting it to another location on a different wall closer to the employees, turning down the base entirely, having a radio in the back where kitchen is or having 1 ear bud in her ear so she can listen to music and listen out for customers.   Again, these are just suggestions.  She did lower the base while I was there but made several complaints about this situation.  She stated that the music “affects her mood” and if she can’t hear it then she will be in a “bad mood!.”  She also said that the music is what keeps the customers coming back and if she is not able to have the music loud, “which will produce a good vibe,” then it will affect sales for the business.  Background music should be just that; background music.  Please resolve this ongoing issue as soon as possible before the tenants call the authorities.  If you have any questions, please give us a call.  Thank you
